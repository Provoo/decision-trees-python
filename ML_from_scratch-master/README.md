Machine Learning Algorithms written from scratch.


## Neural Nets

To test it run `main.py`. 

The core module is `NeuralNetSGD` which trains the neural net using stochastic gradient descent which is using back propogation for getting the gradient. 

`mnsit_load.py` is for loading the mnsit dataset.
